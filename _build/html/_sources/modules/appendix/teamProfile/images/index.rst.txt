``Joy`` has graduated from a mediocre college for sake of a degree. An average student & has not trodden through the conventional route. But, now she is striking out a new path for herself.
Passionately aim to build - Aliyda: A Blockchain-based platform for rape victims. This solution will address numerous acute pain points that cause unnecessary delay in the deliverance of justice.

    Bringing the top of the pyramid knowledge to bottom of the pyramid students

Luckily, Joy has been part of a grass-root level initiative “Osive” which strives to achieve the goal of: “Bringing the top of the pyramid knowledge to bottom of the pyramid students”. This helped her evolve from a nobody to a person of value who could conduct technical knowledge imparting sessions at many Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges.

Made grass-root level efforts along with my peers to formulate: “Talent Enrichment Pipeline". Vision is to filter raw talent, enrich the students with core technical knowledge, and refine them to diamonds.
