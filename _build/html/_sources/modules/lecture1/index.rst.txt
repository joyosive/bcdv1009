Comparison Essay
----------------
The common basis of both Dai and Centre stablecoin is  ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.

The proof that Dai works is that each Dai has been consistently worth $1 USD. As Dai continues to successfully maintain its USD peg, faith in Dai will increase.Dai is a game changer because it allows USD to be transferred in any amount, instantly, across borders, without fees, without any interference. This enables a new era of commerce that exists purely within the blockchain and cannot be shutdown.
Whereas CENTRE envisions new open standards for money on the internet which enable money to work the same way that information and content works online â€” instant, global, open, and free to use and exchange.CENTRE intends to enable coins to function across multiple chains, including both public and private chains.The first CENTRE stablecoin was chosen to be US Dollar Coin (USDC) because of the critical role of USD markets in the global crypto asset marketplace.CENTRE will grow its fiat token support beyond the US dollar by introducing new currencies to its network.
